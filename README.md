# Frontend

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.5.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Development comments

The frontend is using a regular angular application that includes interceptors to inject the jwt token for each request to backend.

It uses path routes to navigate pages using components.

I used services to work as communication process to validate and interact with data, that is used from components.
